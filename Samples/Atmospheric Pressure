You know that there is air all around
us. This envelop of air is known as the
atmosphere. The atmospheric air
extends up to many kilometres above
the surface of the earth. The pressure
exerted by this air is known as
atmospheric pressure. We know that
pressure is force per unit area. If we
imagine a unit area and a very long
cylinder standing on it filled with air,
then the force of gravity on the air in
this cylinder is the atmospheric
pressure.Atmospheric pressure is the force of
gravity on air in a column of unit area But, how large or small is the
atmospheric pressure? Let us get an
idea about its magnitude.Take a good quality rubber sucker.
It looks like a small rubber cup (Fig.
11.18). Press it hard on a smooth
plane surface. Does it stick to the
surface? Now try to pull it off the
surface. Can you do it? A rubber sucker pressed on a
surface When you press the sucker, most of
the air between its cup and the surface
escapes out. The sucker sticks to the
sur face because the pr essure of
atmosphere acts on it. To pull the sucker
off the surface, the applied force should
be large enough to overcome the
atmospheric pressure. This activity
might give you an idea about the
magnitude of atmospheric pressure. In
fact, it would not be possible for any
human being to pull the sucker off the
surface if there were no air at all between
the sucker and the surface. Does it give
you an idea how large the atmospheric
pressure is?If the area of my head
were 15 cm × 15 cm, how
much force air will exert
on my head?
The force due to air in a column of
the height of the atmosphere and area
15 cm × 15 cm (Fig. 11.19) is nearly
equal to the force of gravity on an object
of mass 225 kg (2250N). The reason we
are not crushed under this force of
gravity is that the pressure inside our
bodies is also equal to the atmospheric
pressure and balances the pressure from
outside.Pressure of atmosphere on
