Pressure:
You have learnt in Class VII that strong
winds during a storm or a cyclone can
blow away even the roof-tops. You also
learnt that winds and cyclones are
caused by the differences in air
pressure. Is there any relation between
pressure and force? Let us find out.
Try to push a nail into a wooden
plank by its head. Did you succeed? Try
now to push the nail by the pointed end
(Fig. 11.12). Could you do it this time?
Try cutting vegetables with a blunt
knife and then with a sharp knife. Which
is easier?
Do you get the feeling that the area
over which the force is applied (for
example, the pointed end of the nail)
plays a role in making these tasks easier?
The force acting on a unit area of a
surface is called pressure.
pressure = force / area on which it acts
At this stage we consider only those
forces which act perpendicular to the
surface on which the pressure is to
be computed.
I now understand why
porters place a round piece
of cloth on their heads,
when they have to carry
heavy loads (Fig. 11.13). By
doing this they increase the
area of contact of the load
with their head. So, the
pressure on their head is
reduced and they find it
easier to carry the load.
Note that the area is in the
denominator in the above expression.
So, the smaller the area, larger the
pressure on a surface for the same force.
The area of the pointed end of the nail
is much smaller than that of its head.
The same force, therefore, produces a
pressure sufficient to push the pointed
end of the nail into the wooden plank.
Can you explain now why shoulder
bags are provided with broad straps and
not thin strap? And, why the tools
meant for cutting and piercing always
have sharp edges?
Do liquids and gases also exert
pressure? Does it also depend on the
area on which the force acts? Let us
find out.
