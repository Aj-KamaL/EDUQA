A Force can Change the
State of Motion
Let us now find out what happens when
a force acts on an object.
Take a rubber ball and place it on a
level surface such as a table top or
a concrete floor. Now, gently push
the ball along the level surface
(Fig. 11.6). Does the ball begin to
move? Push the ball again while it
is still moving. Is there any change
in its speed? Does it increase or
decrease?
Next, place your palm in front
of the moving ball. Remove your
palm as soon as the moving ball
touches it. Does your palm apply a
force on the ball? What happens to
the speed of the ball now? Does it
increase or decrease? What would
happen if you let your palm hold
the moving ball?
Fig. 11.6 : A ball at rest begins to move
when a force is applied on it
You might recall similar situations.
For example, while taking a penalty kick
in football, the player applies a force on
the ball. Before being hit, the ball was at
rest and so its speed was zero. The
applied force makes the ball move
towards the goal. Suppose, the
goalkeeper dives or jumps up to save the
goal. By his action the goalkeeper tries
to apply a force on the moving ball. The
force applied by him can stop or deflect
the ball, saving a goal being scored. If
the goalkeeper succeeds in stopping the
ball, its speed decreases to zero.
These observations suggest that a
force applied on an object may change
its speed. If the force applied on the object
is in the direction of its motion, the speed
of the object increases. If the force is
applied in the direction opposite to the
direction of motion, then it results in a
decrease in the speed of the object.
I have seen
children competing with one
another in moving a rubber tyre
or a ring by pushing it
(Fig. 11.7). I now understand
why the speed of the tyre
increases whenever it is
pushed.
To move a tyre faster it has to be
pushed repeatedly.
Paheli is curious to know whether
application of a force can only change the
speed of an object. Let us find out.
Activity 11.4
Take a ball and place it on a level
surface as you did in Activity 11.3.
Make the ball move by giving it a
push [Fig. 11.8(a)]. Now place a ruler
in its path as shown in Fig. 11.8(b).
In doing so, you would apply a force
on the moving ball. Does the ball
continue to move in the same
direction after it strikes the ruler?
Repeat the activity and try to
obstruct the moving ball by placing
the ruler in such a way that it
makes different angles to its path.
In each case note your observations
about the direction of motion of the
ball after it strikes the ruler.
Let us consider some more
examples. In a game of volleyball,
players often push the moving ball to
their team mates to make a winning
move. Sometimes the ball is returned
to the other side of the court by
pushing or smashing it. In cricket, a
batsman plays his or her shot by
applying a force on the ball with the
bat. Is there any change in the
direction of motion of the ball in these
cases? In all these examples the speed
and the direction of the moving ball
change due to the application of a
force. Can you give a few more
examples of this kind?
A change in either the speed of an
object, or its direction of motion, or both,
is described as a change in its state of
motion. Thus, a force may bring a
change in the state of motion of an
object.
State of Motion
The state of motion of an object is
described by its speed and the
direction of motion. The state of rest
is considered to be the state of zero
speed. An object may be at rest or in
motion; both are its states of motion.

 A ball set in motion by
pushing it along a level surface
and the direction of motion
of the ball after it strikes the
ruler placed in its path
Does it mean that the application of
a force would always result in a change
in the state of motion of the object? Let
us find out.
It is common experience that many
a time application of force does not result
in a change in the state of motion. For
example, a heavy box may not move at
all even if you apply the maximum force
that you can exert. Again, no effect of
force is observed when you try to push
a wall.
Force can Change the
Shape of an Object
What do you conclude from the
observations noted in Table 11.2?
What happens when you apply a force
on an inflated balloon by pressing it
between your palms? What happens
to the shape of a ball of dough when it
is rolled to make a chapati? What
happens when you press a rubber ball
placed on a table? In all these
examples you saw that the application
of force on an object may change its
shape.
Having performed all the above
activities, you would have realised that
a force
l
may make an object move from rest.
l
may change the speed of an object
if it is moving.
l
may change the direction of motion 
of an object.
l
may bring about a change in the
shape of an object.
l
may cause some or all of these
effects.
While a force may cause one or more
of these effects, it is important to
remember that none of these actions can
take place without the action of a force.
Thus, an object cannot move by itself,
it cannot change speed by itself, it
cannot change direction by itself and
its shape cannot change by itself.
